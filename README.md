# OpenFlow
OpenFlow framework is an open source extension to the [INET-Framework](https://inet.omnetpp.org/) for the event-based simulation of real-time Ethernet in the [OMNEST/OMNeT++](https://omnetpp.org/) simulation system. It provides implementations for network devices, controllers and controller applications supporting the [OpenFlow protocol](https://www.opennetworking.org/software-defined-standards/specifications/). It was originally created by the University of WÃ¼rzburg, Germany and is now managed within the [INET frameworks](https://github.com/inet-framework/openflow).

This fork contains modified sources to increase compatibility to the other frameworks developed at the [CoRE (Communication over Realtime Ethernet)](https://core-researchgroup.de/) research group at the [HAW-Hamburg (Hamburg University of Applied Sciences)](https://www.haw-hamburg.de/english.html).
